/* Notes */
 - Each resource fork you attempt to read from MUST be within
   a single extent!

/* For future reference: */
All floating types follow IEEE:
(Metrowerks Inc., CodeWarrior ® C, C , and Assembly Language Reference. p. 28-29.)
 - float: 32-bit -> 1.17549e-38 to 3.40282e+38
 - short double: 64-bit-> 2.22507e-308 to 1.79769e+308
 - double: 64-bit -> 2.22507e-308 to 1.79769e+308
 - long double: 64-bit -> 2.22507e-308 to 1.79769e+308

Note : Since long/short double is the same as double
 on PowerPC, you should replace all long/short doubles with
 regular doubles in the PowerPC code (makes life much easier).
 (Fun fact: PowerPC doesn't support long doubles at all.)

Other types (I found these):
 long: 32-bit
 short: 16-bit

Padding on PowerPC according to CodeWarrior:
(Metrowerks Inc., CodeWarrior® Targeting Mac OS. p. 97.)
 - char: 1-byte boundary
 - int16_t: 2-byte boundary
 - int32_t: 4-byte boundary
 - int64_t: 8-byte boundary
 - float: 4-byte boundary
 - double: 8-byte boundary
 - long double: 8-byte boundary
 - struct: alignment of largest scalar type in struct
